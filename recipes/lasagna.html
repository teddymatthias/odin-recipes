<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than 20 years ago, he had no idea 
    how successful it would become. One of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna 
    racks up more than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular lasagna recipes on the 
    internet for two decades. Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old</p>

<ul> 
    <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
    <li><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Tomato Products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
    <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Spices and Seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
    <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
    <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
